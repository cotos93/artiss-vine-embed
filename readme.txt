Embed Vine videos into your blog

== Description ==

Embed your Vine videos directly into your posts, pages or sidebar. Features include...

* Embed your Vine video with a simple shortcode or use widgets in your sidebar
* Use the video ID or full URL
* Specify video size and type (simple or postcard)
* Administration screen allows you to specify default options
* Google compatible metadata is added to the video output - great for SEO!

This isn't the first WordPress plugin to embed Vine videos but it will certainly be the best!

How do you do it? Simply use the shortcode [vine] with at least a parameter specifying the video ID. For example...

`[vine id=bjHh0zHdgZT]`

To specify a full URL you will need to enclose it within both opening and closing shortcode. For example...

`[vine]https://vine.co/v/bjHh0zHdgZT[/vine]`

Default output settings can be defined via an administration screen. Click on "Media" in the menu sidebar and there will be a sub-menu named "Vine Embeds". Click on this to specify default size and video type.

To change the defaults on an individual basis use the `size` or `type` parameters. The latter can be set to `simple` or `postcard`. For example...

`[vine size=480 type=postcard]bjHh0zHdgZT[/vine]`

And that's it!

In future releases expect the following...

* Editor button to make embedding even easier
* Responsive output of videos
* Internationalization
* And much more!
