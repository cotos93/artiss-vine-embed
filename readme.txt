Embed Vine videos into your blog

== Description ==

Embed your Vine videos directly into your posts, pages or sidebar. Features include...

* Embed your Vine video with a simple shortcode or use widgets in your sidebar
* Use the video ID or full URL
* Specify video size and type (simple or postcard)
* Google compatible metadata is added to the video output - great for SEO!

This isn't the first WordPress plugin to embed Vine videos but it will certainly be the best!

How do you do it? Simply use the shortcode [vine] with at least a parameter specifying the video ID. For example...

`[vine id=bjHh0zHdgZT]`

To specify a full URL you will need to enclose it within both opening and closing shortcode. For example...

`[vine]https://vine.co/v/bjHh0zHdgZT[/vine]`

By default the result will show at a size of 600px and the simple output. To change either of these settings use the `size` or `type` parameters. The latter can be set to `simple` or `postcard`. For example...

`[vine size=480 type=postcard]bjHh0zHdgZT[/vine]`

And that's it!

For the next release (due imminently) expect an administration screen so that you can set default options.

In future releases then expect the following...

* Editor button to make embedding even easier
* Responsive output of videos
* Internationalization
* And much more!
